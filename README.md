* Welcome to the Forest 
** This is the README file for this Magic Eight Ball based project.

The goals for this project:
   - Create a webpage that has a forest image and central box
   - Have the text box have a name and a question input
   - Have a dialogue that changes based on the inputs
   - Allow users to talk to a forest deity, and ask her for predictions
   - Have the forest deity count the number of questions that are asked
   - When 3 questions have been asked, send them to the sea witch, for a different set of responses (different web page?)
   - Have a 'good' or 'bad' variable that means that they can say 'I'm sorry', or 'I'm happy for you' accurately - ie. input that asks whether this is something we want or not
   - Incorporate a background image (try to get alternative text for the background image)
